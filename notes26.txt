2.)Network actions along source-to-dest path

VC imploementation

a VC consists of 

1.) Path from source to destination

2.) VC numbers, one number for each link along the path

3.)entries in forwarding tables in routers along path.

packet beloinging to VC carries VC number



VC number is recieved upon packet arriving at the router and vc number is changed upon exiting.

It is this way to AVOID HAVING TO HAVE A GLOBAL ACCESSING SCHEME. do NOT NEED TO HAVE A GLOBAL ADDRESS.

whoever use

struct person{

        current_rec;


}
read(id,&current_record,sizeof(struct person).



waiting for terminated Child

when a process terminates, the kernel sends the signal SIGCHLD to the parent

What if the parent wants to know more about how the child terminated?

ZOMBIE: kernel puts child into a special process state before it dissapears
-minimal skeleton of what was once the process is retained

wait

----->childis born and executed process and the main parent process will return to the parent after x time had been completed.

------>(child)& runs child file in the background by avoiding the call to wait in the parent

Zombie Process

*process that has terminated but has not been waited on by its parent
*Contunie to consume resources
-until parents issues a wait,then kernel cleans up the process
All parents should  wait on children
What if the parent dies before the child?
children get"re-parented" to init process
*init periodically waits on all children

wait () Actions


(Pro tip always wait on the parents side to catch zombies)

*A process that calls wait () can:

-suspend(block) if all of its children are still running,or
